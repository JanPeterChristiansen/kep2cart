# kep2cart 
Algorithm implemented in Matlab R2020b that calculates Cartesian state vectors from a set of Keplerian orbit elements.  
The input to the algorithm is a set of Keplerian orbit elements:  
  The semi-major axis *a*,  
  eccentricity *e*,  
  argument of periapsis *w*,  
  longitude of ascending node *omega*,  
  inclination *i*,  
  and the mean anomaly *M0*. 
Additionally the time *t* has to be specified.  
The outputs of the algorithm are the Cartesian position and velocity vectors *r* and *v*.
